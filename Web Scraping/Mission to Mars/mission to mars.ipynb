Even better, it's about to roll for the first time through a replica Martian landscape.\n-----------\nAn electronics issue is suspected to be preventing the sensors from sharing their data about Mars weather with the spacecraft.\n-----------\nA crisply rendered web application can show you where the agency's Mars 2020 mission is right now as it makes its way to the Red Planet for a Feb. 18, 2021, landing.\n-----------\nThe board will assist with analysis of current plans and goals for one of the most difficult missions humanity has ever undertaken.\n-----------\nHeaded to the Red Planet with the Perseverance rover, the pioneering helicopter is powered up for the first time in interplanetary space as part of a systems check.\n-----------\nMarking its 15th anniversary since launch, one of the oldest spacecraft at the Red Planet has provided glimpses of dust devils, avalanches, and more.\n-----------\nVast areas of the Martian night sky pulse in ultraviolet light, according to images from NASA’s MAVEN spacecraft. The results are being used to illuminate complex circulation patterns in the Martian atmosphere.\n-----------\nThe NASA rover touched down eight years ago, on Aug. 5, 2012, and will soon be joined by a second rover, Perseverance.\n-----------\nThe agency's Mars 2020 mission is on its way. It will land at Jezero Crater in about seven months, on Feb. 18, 2021. \n-----------\nIn a Q&A, spacesuit designer Amy Ross explains how five samples, including a piece of helmet visor, will be tested aboard the rover, which is targeting a July 30 launch. \n-----------\nWith a targeted launch date of July 30, the next robotic scientist NASA is sending to the to the Red Planet has big ambitions.\n-----------\nThere are lots of ways to participate in the historic event, which is targeted for July 30.\n-----------\n​The agency's Mars 2020 mission has one more big prelaunch review – the Launch Readiness Review, on July 27.\n-----------\nStarting July 27, news activities will cover everything from mission engineering and science to returning samples from Mars to, of course, the launch itself.\n-----------\nThe first helicopter attempting to fly on another planet is a marvel of engineering. Get up to speed with these key facts about its plans.\n-----------\nNo matter where you live, choose from a menu of activities to join NASA as we \"Countdown to Mars\" and launch the Perseverance rover to the Red Planet.\n-----------\nReady for its launch later in the month, the Mars-bound rover will touch terra firma no more.\n-----------\nNASA's next rover to the Red Planet is slated to launch no earlier than July 30. These highlights will get you up to speed on the ambitious mission.\n-----------\nNow that the lander's robotic arm has helped the mole get underground, it will resume science activities that have been on hold.\n-----------\nAfter more than a year in the \"clay-bearing unit,\" Curiosity is making a mile-long journey around some deep sand so that it can explore higher up Mount Sharp.\n-----------\nThe small craft will seek to prove that powered, controlled flight is possible on another planet. But just getting it onto the surface of Mars will take a whole lot of ingenuity.\n-----------\nThe Red Planet's surface has been visited by eight NASA spacecraft. The ninth will be the first that includes a roundtrip ticket in its flight plan. \n-----------\nLearn more about the agency's next Red Planet mission during a live event on June 17.\n-----------\nThis new portrait of the Red Planet's neighbors was taken during a time when there's more dust in the air on Mars.\n-----------\nUsing an online tool to label Martian terrain types, you can train an artificial intelligence algorithm that could improve the way engineers guide the Curiosity rover.\n-----------\nTaken with the infrared camera aboard NASA's Odyssey orbiter, they reveal temperature variations on the small moon as it drifts into and out of Mars’ shadow.\n-----------\nTwo astronauts collected Moon rocks on Apollo 11. It will take three robotic systems working together to gather up the first Mars rock samples for return to Earth.\n-----------\nAn instrument called SHERLOC will, with the help of its partner WATSON, hunt for signs of ancient life by detecting organic molecules and minerals.\n-----------\nFive years after NASA’s MAVEN spacecraft entered into orbit around Mars, data from the mission has led to the creation of a map of electric current systems in the Martian atmosphere.\n-----------\nA NASA Wallops Flight Facility cargo plane transported more than two tons of equipment — including the rover's sample collection tubes — to Florida for this summer's liftoff.\n-----------\nWinners include the JPL-managed \"Send Your Name to Mars\" campaign, NASA's Global Climate Change website and Solar System Interactive.\n-----------\nThe agency's new Mars rover is put through a series of tests in vacuum chambers, acoustic chambers and more to get ready for the Red Planet.\n-----------\nStacking spacecraft components on top of each other is one of the final assembly steps before a mission launches to the Red Planet. \n-----------\nTeam members searched for signs of ancient microscopic life there, just as NASA's latest rover will on the Red Planet next year.\n-----------\nA pair of zoomable cameras will help scientists and rover drivers with high-resolution color images.\n-----------\nThese are the scientists and engineers who built NASA's next Mars rover and who will guide it to a safe landing in Jezero Crater. \n-----------\nAs a longtime fan of space exploration, Vaneeza Rupani appreciates the creativity and collaboration involved with trying to fly on another planet.\n-----------\nVaneeza Rupani's essay was chosen as the name for the small spacecraft, which will mark NASA's first attempt at powered flight on another planet.\nScraping Complete\n"
